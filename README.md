# Forward-Algorithm-Sample-Code
Forward Algorithm (based on Viterbi) for Computing the Lexical Probabilities of Words in a Sentence.

This sample code demonstrates how to implement a probability based lexical category tagger for words in a sentence(s). This was implemented from the pseudo-code & details of [**Allen, J. (1995). Natural language understanding (2nd ed). Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co.**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/199291) course book for the NLP course.
