# Forward-Algorithm-Sample-Code
Forward Algorithm (based on Viterbi) for Computing the Lexical Probabilities of Words in a Sentence.

This sample code demonstrates how to implement a probability based word lexical category tagger. This is implemented from the pseudo-code & details from [**Allen, J. (1995). Natural language understanding (2nd ed). Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co.**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/199291) course book for NLP course.
